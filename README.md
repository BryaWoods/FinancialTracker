# Financial Tracker Application ðŸ’°

## Description of the Project

The Financial Tracker Java console application is designed to help users manage their financial 
transactions effectively. Its purpose is to provide a convenient way for users to track their deposits, 
payments (debits), and overall account activity. The intended users of this application are individuals 
or small businesses who want to maintain a clear record of their financial transactions.

#### Main Functionality:

Home Screen:
Users are presented with options to add deposits, make payments (debits), view the ledger, generate reports, or exit the application.

    Add Deposit (D) and Make Payment (P):
Users can input deposit or payment information, including date, time, description, vendor, and amount. The application then saves this information to a CSV file, ensuring a record of all financial activities.

    Ledger (L):
The ledger screen displays all financial entries. Users can choose to view all entries, only deposits, or only payments (debits).

    Reports (R):
- Users can generate pre-defined reports for specific time periods such as Month To Date, Previous Month, Year To Date, Previous Year, and Vendor. 
Additionally, they can search for transactions by Custom Search, 
this feature allows users to perform a detailed search based on specific criteria, including start date, end date, description, vendor, and amount. 
The application filters entries based on the entered criteria, offering a customized view of financial transactions.
The application will also log all custom searches and save them to a SearchLog.csv.


#### Purpose and Problem Solving:

The Financial Tracker application aims to solve the problem of manual financial tracking and organization. 
It provides a structured platform for users to record deposits, payments, and other financial activities seamlessly. 
By maintaining an accurate ledger and offering reporting functionalities, the application empowers users to gain 
insights into their financial status, identify spending trends, and make informed decisions about budgeting and financial planning. 
Overall, this Java console application simplifies financial management for individuals and small businesses, ensuring clarity 
and efficiency in tracking financial transactions.
